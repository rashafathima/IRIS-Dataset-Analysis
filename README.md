# IRIS-Dataset-Analysis

## Case Study : Data Analysis of IRIS Dataset (the most sought datasets for Classification Problems) using Linear Regression and K-Nearest-Neighbor Algorithms

## Data : 

Iris Dataset is one of the most soughted datasets for classification problems. The dataset consists of 150 instances; 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination and study of all these features in the sample, we were able to distinguish one species from another, by trying out the model using both KNN Algorithm and Logistic Regression.
